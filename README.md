# Bird Nest

## The App:
Bird Nest is a mobile app which provides a faster and more intuitive method of finding housing and roommates for university students.

## Motivation:
Contemporary platforms, such as Facebook Groups, just aren’t built to facilitate this kind of search. The lack of candidate filters, student-status verification, and housing/roommate-oriented profiles leads to a prolonged and unpleasant search process.

## Features:
Bird Nest improves upon this process by offering personal profiles with **questionnaires** and displayed traits geared towards housing preferences; **sorting algorithms** that rank potential roommates based on number of matched preferences; **filtering algorithms** which, on top of the sorting feature, allows users to apply more granular and variable specifications on which type of roommate is desired; **messaging** capabilities and much, much more. 

## My Role:
This was developed during SDSC’s summer program in a team of 7, in which I led overall development as Product Owner.
